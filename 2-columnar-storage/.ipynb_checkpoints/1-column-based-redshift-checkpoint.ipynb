    "If we think about an OLTP database that powers an application versus an OLAP database that are used for analytics, they are used in pretty different ways, and because of this, they were constructed pretty differently.  So let's start by seeing some of the differences between how an **OLTP** database is used an how an **OLAP** database is used. "

    "With our OLTP queries, we are performing queries for a web application.  And these queries often involve a single entity.  For example, with our ecommerce application example, we may need to return information about a single user (like the logged in user), or a single product, or a single order.   When doing so, we want to view many of the attributes in that row - like multiple details about a user or product. "

For example, we may not need to know everything about a particular user -- like the name, and street address. Rather, what's more likely would be for us to see the different zipcodes or ages across multiple users.  \n",

But with an OLAP database, we would need multiple rows of data, as we care generally care about information in the aggregate.  And we may only need a couple columns of data, like states and zipcodes of recent users."
